It looks natural, because it resembles the way we read and listen to speech. However, since in many practical cases we have random access to the input sequence, it might make sense to run recurrent computation in both directions. Such networks are call **bidirectional** RNNs, and they can be created by passing `bidirectional=True` parameter to RNN/LSTM/GRU constructor.\n","\n","When dealing with bidirectional network, we would need two hidden state vectors, one for each direction.

As with convolutional networks, we can build another recurrent layer on top of the first one to capture higher level patterns, build from low-level patterns extracted by the first layer. This leads us to the notion of **multi-layer RNN**, which consists of two or more recurrent networks, where output of the previous layer is passed to the next layer as input.\n","\n","![Image showing a Multilayer long-short-term-memory- RNN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-natural-language-processing-pytorch/images/multi-layer-lstm.jpg)\n","\n","*Picture from [this wonderful post](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-a-lstm-cell-to-a-multilayer-lstm-network-with-pytorch-2899eb5696f3) by Fernando López*\n","\n","PyTorch makes constructing such networks an easy task, because you just need to pass `num_layers` parameter to RNN/LSTM/GRU constructor to build several layers of recurrence automatically.
